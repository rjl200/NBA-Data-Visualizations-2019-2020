This file contains visitations about the score over time during two games in the 2019-2020 season where the Minnesota Timberwolves played the Los Angeles Clippers. Both games were played at the Target Center, the Timberwolves home court. _**Additionally I include a scatter plot and regression showing the Timberwolves points scored over time for the entire season.**_
