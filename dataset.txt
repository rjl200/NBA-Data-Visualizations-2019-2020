The dataset I am choosing to analyze contains play by play data of the 2019-2020 NBA season.
I am using this dataset because first off, I love basketball and the NBA, but I also believe some
insightful analytics can be done using this data. 

Using this data I could examine the effectiveness of various shot types, like layups, hooks, dunks,
and 2-pt and 3-pt jump shots. I could then create a bar chart with the x-axis as the shot types
and the y-axis could be the count of made or missed shots or even the percentage of made shots.

Additionally I could analyze a teams performance in a game with time out of 48 mins on the x-axis
and points scored on the y-axis. This visualization would allow us to see the moments throughout the game when
a team is scoring the most. Maybe right at the beginning, when everyones legs are fresh or maybe at the end when 
everyone is fully warmed up. 

These are just some visualization ideas that initially come to mind.
